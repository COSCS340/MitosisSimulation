Interphase
Nucleolus:
Within the nucleolus, chromosomes are being replicated as the cell prepared for cellular division. This particular process within 
the cell is highly regulated by cyclins, cylin-dependent kinases, and other cell cycle proteins.

Prophase
Miotic Spindle:
Close to the nucleus are structures called centrosomes, consisting of a pair of centrioles surrounded by a loose collection of proteins.
The centrosome is the coordinating center for the cell's microtubules. A cell inherits a single centrosome at cell division, which is 
duplicated by the cell before a new round of mitosis begins, giving a pair of centrosomes. 
Nucleolus:
During interphase, the material inside the nucleolus is loosely packed chromatin. When prophase starts, the chromatin condenses into 
solid chromosomes.
Chromosomes:
Each chromosome has two chromatids, which are joined together at the centromere. 

Prometaphase
Miotic Spindle:
Microtubules invade the nuclear space. This is called open mitosis.
Chromosomes:
In late prometaphase, kinetochore microtubules begin to search for and attach to chromosomal kinetochores.
Metaphase
Chromosomes:
The resulting tension causes the chromosomes to align along the metaphase plateor equatorial plane, an imaginary line that is centrally 
located between the two centrosomes (at approximately the midline of the cell).

Anaphase
Chromosomes:
In late anaphase, chromosomes also reach their overall maximal condensation level, to help chromosome segregation and the re-formation
of the nucleus.

Telophase
Chromosomes:
Both sets of chromosomes, now surrounded by new nuclear membrane, begin to "relax" or decondense.
